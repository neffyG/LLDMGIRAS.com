                Theme: Strengthening the Faith--<br>
                *The Apostle of the Lord shared his desire to convey a message of comfort, love, and edification to the brethren in Melbourne.<br>
                *He began his address by citing a phrase from the start of his ministry: "You were not alone."<br>
                *He emphasized that this phrase should be inscribed in the hearts and minds of the brethren.<br>
                *The purpose of this reminder is to encourage them to remember it during times of trial or affliction.<br>
                *He assured that God did not abandon His children adrift; instead, He raised another Apostle among His People.<br>
                <br>
                "Faith is the certainty of things; it is the conviction of what we believe, that even though we do not see it, we know it 
                is there, we know it exists, we know that is faith. And that faith, God placed in your heart so that through it you may live with joy.
                You do not live in sadness or without hope; on the contrary, I know you believe in God, I know you believe in Christ, 
                I know you believe in His promises, I know you believe in hope. He promised to one day grant us an inheritance. How do you believe it if 
                you have not seen it materially? Through that faith that Christ placed in our hearts."(Apostle of Jesus Christ, Naasón Joaquín García)

                *On February 14th, on the island of Maui, Hawaii, the Apostle of Jesus Christ, Naasón Joaquín García, concluded the International Baptism Ceremony.<br>

                "This makes us heirs and co-heirs because we will not only inherit from God, but Christ shares 
                with us what was uniquely inherited by Him from God... Jesus Christ shares with us, makes us co-heirs, 
                and allows us to partake in that blessing and glory that was meant solely for Him. All of us who were called, 
                all who descended into the baptismal waters, all without exception—if 
                God brought you into His people, it is because He wanted to make you His child."(Apostle of Jesus Christ, Naasón Joaquín García)
